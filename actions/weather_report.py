"""Weather report skill: the `weather_report` tool.

Opens a Google weather search for the requested city (and optional day) in the
user's default browser, so the answer is the live weather card rather than
text scraped or guessed by the model. The handler returns a short spoken
sentence, logs it to the HUD, and records the search in session memory when
that is available.

A missing city or a browser that cannot be opened is returned as a spoken
message instead of raising. Discovered automatically through the module-level
`TOOL` dict (see core/action_loader.py).
